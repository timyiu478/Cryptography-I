# Cryptography-I

This repository contains projects from the [**Cryptography I**](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/soe-y0001-cryptography-i) course by Dan Boneh, Stanford University. These projects provide hands-on experience with cryptographic principles and techniques.

|------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Many Time Pad Attack              | Understand the vulnerabilities when a stream cipher key is reused and apply XOR operations.   | [Project Details](programming_assignments/week1/)                   |
| 2    | AES CBC and CTR Modes             | Implement AES encryption/decryption using CBC and CTR modes with proper padding and IV usage. | [Project Details](programming_assignments/week2/)                   |
| 3    | File Authentication System: Hash Chain | Build a hash chain-based system for file integrity and authentication.                        | [Project Details](programming_assignments/week3/)                   |
| 4 | Padding Orchard Attack | Implement a padding oracle attack to exploit vulnerabilities in padding schemes.              | [Project Details](programming_assignments/week4/)                   |
| 5 | Discrete Logarithm Algorithm | Implement a discrete logarithm algorithm with a meet-in-the-middle attack.     | [Project Details](programming_assignments/week5/)                   |
