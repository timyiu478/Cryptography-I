| 1    | Many Time Pad Attack              | Understand the vulnerabilities when a stream cipher key is reused and apply XOR operations.   | [Project Details](programming_assignments/week1/)                   |
| 2    | AES CBC and CTR Modes             | Implement AES encryption/decryption using CBC and CTR modes with proper padding and IV usage. | [Project Details](programming_assignments/week2/)                   |
| 3    | File Authentication System: Hash Chain | Build a hash chain-based system for file integrity and authentication.                        | [Project Details](programming_assignments/week3/)                   |
| 4 | **Padding Orchard Attack** | Implement a padding oracle attack to exploit vulnerabilities in padding schemes.              | [Project Details](programming_assignments/week4/)                   |
